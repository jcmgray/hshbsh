# hshbsh

## Usage

```python
>>> import hshbsh as hb
>>> hb.hello()
'Hello World!'
>>> hb.hello('Johnnie')
'Hello Johnnie!'
```

## Installation

1. Straight from github:

```bash
pip install -U git+git://github.com/jcmgray/hshbsh.git
```

2. From inside a local clone, allowing for edits to the source:
```bash
pip install -U -e .
```

Add ``--no-deps`` if you don't any ``pip`` to try and install the package requirements (e.g. they are already installed via ``conda``, pip sometimes doesn't recognise this).
